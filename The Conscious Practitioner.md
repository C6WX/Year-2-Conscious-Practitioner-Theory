## LO1 - Media Messages and Audiences (756 words) (718 w/o quote)
Cultural perspectives, values, beliefs and identities completely shape the way different forms of media is encoded and decoded. Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding model (Hall, S. 1973) explains how producers and authors create media around their own religious and cultural beliefs and encode messages and meanings into their own work. Whereas the audience of the work decodes what the creator has made and creates their own meaning or comes to the meaning intended by the author. The meaning decoded by the audience is affected by the different factors stated previously. Within Stuart Halls's encoding/decoding model, there are three different ways of interpreting media; preferred/dominant reading, oppositional reading and negotiated reading. Preferred reading is the way the producer wants the audience to interpret their work. Oppositional reading is when the audience completely ignores the preferred reading that the author is trying to portray and created their own meaning of their work. The third way is negotiated reading which is an in-between of the other two ways, where the reader accepts the preferred reading but also has their own views on the work.

For example, Call of Duty Modern Warfare (Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, 2019) is a game with an encoded message surrounding the ideas of patriotism, the morals of war and national security as well as certain political and cultural perspective centered around western military. There are many different decoded perspectives on this game, one of the main ones is the people who connected with the message that the game developers wanted to be seen and saw the game as a true portrayal of modern combat and a celebration of soldier's sacrifices. The opposing view of this game and message primarily originates from countries that are seen as the opposition within the game and they see it as political propaganda.

Another example of this is the popular Netflix tv series, Squid Game (Squid Game, 2021). This show discusses so many dystopian topics about todays society that the main message that the director wanted to deliver is lost in all the different interpretations of the show. The preferred message encoded into the show is all about Korean social hierarchies, economic equality and collective trauma. As discussed by John Feffer (Feffer, 2021) "Household debt in South Korea is over 100 percent of the country’s GDP. Housing is expensive while secure jobs are scarce. A few years ago, young people started referring to their country as Hell Chosun, a place where they simply couldn’t get ahead." This is truly showcased within the show as 456 people would rather risk their own lives to pay off their debt then go back home empty handed and continue living their lives the way they have been. Even with the option to go home after finding out the risk involved in playing the game show, they still continue to play. Although this isn't the part of the show viewers tend to focus all their attention on, it truly does show how dystopian living in South Korea truly is. Problems with social hierarchies is explored when the audience discovers that the only reason the game show exists is to entertain the wealthy. The lives of all the players mean nothing to them just because they don't have as much money so to them, don't matter if they died. As long as the rich are happy, thats all that matters.

The negotiated interpretation of the message portrayed by the show is the exact same as the preferred message however the viewers are applying it to problems in their own country. Brazilian viewers might link the message behind squid game to their own nation's problems with poverty and political corruption whereas british viewers may link the message to england's rising living crisis and class barriers. The oppositional view on Squid Game's message is that the show is overly critical of the topics that it discusses, with some viewers even seeing it as anti-capitalist propaganda.
<br>
I feel that interpreting media is just as important as creating it when it comes to understanding its impact because releasing a piece of media without thinking about the cultural impact it could cause or the different negative views that can be created when decoding that piece of media could cause the created media to be seen more negatively then the original message that was supposed to be decoded from it. Whereas, a creator who looks into different ways that what they are making could be decoded negatively, it could be edited to further portray the encoded message without accidentally creating a negative message.
