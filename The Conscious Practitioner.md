## Week 3 - The politics of authorship (248 words)
Freida McFadden is an internationally bestselling author known for psychological thrillers such as "The Housemaid," which became an international bestseller and is being adapted into a movie. She writes under a pen name and is also a practising physician specialising in brain injury, balancing a dual life that influences her work.
<br>
She views writing as a thrilling, immersive experience, describing it like "jumping out of a plane" (Coffey, 2025). She spends months planning a book before rapidly completing the first draft, and then spends about a year editing. Her success is something she attributes partly to luck, recognising that many talented writers may not achieve the same visibility.
<br>
She values the role of the author as a storyteller who crafts engaging and emotionally compelling narratives. Writing in a conversational style, often in first person, she aims to make readers feel connected, as if listening to a friend share gossip, to evoke strong emotions and engagement. Her identity as a practising medical doctor shapes the medical and psychological elements in her novels, while her anonymity as an author protects her professional relationships. She writes relatable female protagonists who face ordinary challenges but get drawn into extraordinary, life threatening situations, emphasising the psychological thriller genre's immersive and personal nature.
<br>
McFaddens' creater identity influences how readers evaluate her work, particularly through her skilful use of plot twists and suspense. Her professional doctor's perspective adds authenticity to medical details in her stories, making her a unique figure in contemporary psychological thriller authorship.

## Week 4 - Media Messages and Audiences (301 words)
Cultural perspectives, values, beliefs and identities completely shape the way different forms of media is encoded and decoded. Stuart Hall's encoding/decoding model (1973) explains how producers and authors create media around their own religious and cultural beliefs and encode messages and meanings into their own work. Whereas the audience of the work decodes what the creator has made and creates their own meaning or comes to the meaning intended by the author. The meaning decoded by the audience is affected by the different factors stated previously.
<br>
For example, Call of Duty Modern Warfare (Call Of Duty Modern Warfare, 2019) is a game with an encoded message surrounding the ideas of patriotism, the morals of war and national security as well as certain political and cultural perspective centered around western military. There are many different decoded perspectives on this game, one of the main ones is the people who connected with the message that the game developers wanted to be seen and saw the game as a true portrayal of modern combat and a celebration of soldier's sacrifices. The opposing view of this game and message primarily originates from countries that are seen as the opposition within the game and they see it as political propaganda. 
<br>
I feel that interpreting media is just as important as creating it when it comes to understanding its impact because releasing a piece of media without thinking about the cultural impact it could cause or the different negative views that can be created when decoding that piece of media could cause the created media to be seen more negatively then the original message that was supposed to be decoded from it. Whereas, a creator who looks into different ways that what they are making could be decoded negatively, it could be edited to further portray the encoded message without accidentally creating a negative message.
