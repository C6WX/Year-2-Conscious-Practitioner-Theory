## Week 3 - The politics of authorship
Freida McFadden is an internationally bestselling author known for psychological thrillers such as "The Housemaid," which became an international bestseller and is being adapted into a movie. She writes under a pen name and is also a practising physician specialising in brain injury, balancing a dual life that influences her work.
<br>
She views writing as a thrilling, immersive experience, describing it like "jumping out of a plane" (Coffey, 2025). She spends months planning a book before rapidly completing the first draft, and then spends about a year editing. Her success is something she attributes partly to luck, recognising that many talented writers may not achieve the same visibility.
<br>
She values the role of the author as a storyteller who crafts engaging and emotionally compelling narratives. Writing in a conversational style, often in first person, she aims to make readers feel connected, as if listening to a friend share gossip, to evoke strong emotions and engagement. Her identity as a practising medical doctor shapes the medical and psychological elements in her novels, while her anonymity as an author protects her professional relationships. She writes relatable female protagonists who face ordinary challenges but get drawn into extraordinary, life threatening situations, emphasising the psychological thriller genre's immersive and personal nature.
<br>
McFaddens' creater identity influences how readers evaluate her work, particularly through her skilful use of plot twists and suspense. Her professional doctor's perspective adds authenticity to medical details in her stories, making her a unique figure in contemporary psychological thriller authorship.
